# Superbacked docs

This repo is the source behind [superbacked.com/guides](https://superbacked.com/docs) which, we believe, offers a better reading experience than GitHub.

Wish to contribute, please read [this](#how-to-contribute-to-docs) first and consider starring [repo](https://github.com/superbacked/superbacked).

## How to contribute to docs

> Heads-up: please [get in touch](https://superbacked.com/contact) before working on guide and submitting signed pull request.

**If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, we encourage you to let us know immediately using email found on https://superbacked.com/contact before submitting signed pull request.**

Contribution can be as small as fixing a typo or adding device to [recommended hardware](recommended-hardware.md).

This repo only accepts [signed](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) pull requests.

## How to sign pull request

### Step 1: install [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/) (if required)

On macOS, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), then run `brew install gnupg`.

On Ubuntu, run `sudo apt update && sudo apt install`.

### Step 2: create PGP key pair (if required)

> Heads-up: see [this](https://github.com/sunknudsen/guides/tree/main/archive/how-to-generate-and-air-gap-pgp-private-keys-using-gnupg-tails-and-yubikey) archived guide to learn how to manage keys securely (updated guide will be published shortly).

$ gpg --full-generate-key

Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 0
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: John Doe
Email address: john@protonmail.com
Comment:
You selected this USER-ID:
    "John Doe <john@protonmail.com>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

### Step 4: enable Git [signing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work)

> Heads-up: replace `9A676BBA8BBA38079DFDEF7AE9A8AF4CB78129CA` with your PGP public key ID.

```shell-session
$ git config --global commit.gpgsign true

$ git config --global gpg.program $(which gpg)

$ git config --global user.signingkey 9A676BBA8BBA38079DFDEF7AE9A8AF4CB78129CA
```

### Step 5: submit pull request
