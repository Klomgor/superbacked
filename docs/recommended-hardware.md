## How to test hardware and contribute to this list

### Step 1: download and print [reference](./reference-blocks/65bbe27d.pdf) block

### Step 2: download and install Superbacked app or run Superbacked OS

### Step 3: restore reference block in bad lighting (example: at night in dim lighting)

### Step 4: restore reference block in good lighting (example: during the day near a window)

### Step 5: clone repo, create and switch to `recommended-hardware` branch and add line to table at the right position (sorted alphabetically)
