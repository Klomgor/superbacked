## How to verify integrity of release

### Step 1: download [release](https://github.com/superbacked/superbacked/releases)‚Äôs `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.asc` to same folder as app (`superbacked-std-universal-1.6.0.dmg` in example below)

```console
$ ls
SHA256SUMS
SHA256SUMS.asc
superbacked-std-universal-1.6.0.dmg
```

### Step 2 (optional): verify integrity of `SHA256SUMS` using [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/)

> Heads-up: integrity of Sun‚Äôs PGP public key can be confirmed using fingerprint published on https://sunknudsen.com/contact, https://github.com/sunknudsen/pgp-public-key, https://twitter.com/sunknudsen and https://www.youtube.com/sunknudsen/about.

> Heads-up: ‚Äú1 signature not checked due to a missing key‚Äù warning can be ignored as it refers to Sun‚Äôs [legacy](https://github.com/sunknudsen/pgp-public-key/tree/master/legacy) PGP public key.
